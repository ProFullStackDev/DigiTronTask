In this coding assignment you will create a sample mobile application. 
You can use the React Native or React.  This application should exhibit best 
practices for application development where possible. 

Application Requirements: 

1. Using the React Native, build a screen which shows a list of hour long slots from 9am to 5pm. 

2. When one time slot is clicked, load details screen (another page/screen) 
which asks for first name, last name and phone number. Screen will have 2 options - Cancel and Save. 

3. When the name and phone number is submitted/saved, the app should redirected back to 
the main screen and selected timeslot should change to red, indicating the time slot is no longer available. 

4. If the red time slot is clicked on again, redirect again to the details screen with the 
name and phone number for that appointment pre-populated. Users will be able to edit the name 
and phone number to change the user for the appointment. Don’t worry about credentials. 
Any user can update any timeslot, irrespective, it is booked by same user or not. 

5. Create a simple local storage to persist the data as a fallback for the booking data 
since REST endpoints don’t exist. 

6. Add a button on same screen or a new one. Button should open “photo gallery” 
within the app with animation. (only applies for React Native test)

Bonus Points: 

1. Showcase the use of Redux.
2. Make the app look nice :)
